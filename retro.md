- what works well
  - github copilot can read the code context existing in intellij and doesn't require us to provide the context
  - when comparing to VS code we have to add the context file manually.
  - experiments after we finished the exercise.

    
- what can be improved?
  - always review what's the AI says, don't rush.

    
- what did you learn?
  - copilot can do write functional tests, benchmarking for both CPU and memory code, unit tests and optimize performance as well
  - we trace through the algorithm to learn how the new optimized code works.


- what doesn't work well?
  - add examples where copilot doesn't work well
  - add caching doesn't improve the performance nor the memory.
